# Contributing to PSL

You are welcome to contribute to PSL by making a technical contribution to PSL infrastructure like the website and Catalog-Builder, adding a model to the library, or contributing to one of the models already in the library.

When you feel that you have made a valuable contribution, please add it to RELEASES.md. If you think PSL users should know about it, add it to NEWS.md. If your name is not already in contributors.md, add it.

## Submitting a project to PSL

To submit a public policy simulation project to PSL, please bring your model or data preparation routine into compliance with [PSL Criteria](../Catalog/library_criteria.html) and then open a pull request to PSL adding your model to the [PSL Catalog Register](https://github.com/PSLmodels/PSL-Infrastructure/blob/master/Catalog/register.json). The PSL project will then review your PR for public policy relevance and conformance to the PSL Criteria. If you have a question about the process or are unsure of your project's relevance to PSL, please open an [issue](https://github.com/PSLmodels/PSL-Infrastructure/issues).
